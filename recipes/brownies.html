        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I know that saying these are the “best brownies, ever” is a bold statement, but we truly believe it. I love brownies that are rich and extra chocolaty. These brownies with dense, fudgy middles and crinkly tops absolutely deliver! These are perfect for boxed brownie lovers — the dense, moist, and fudgy texture is not all that different from what you can expect from the boxed mixes. It get’s better, though. These brownies are much more flavorful than anything made from a box. They taste amazing.
